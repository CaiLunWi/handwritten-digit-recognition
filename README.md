# handwritten-digit-recognition
This is part of our AI project - handwritting-digit-recognition. Goal of this project is to demonstrate how Machine learning works and particullary how Deep Neural Network works. 
We will use MNIST dataset from kers.datasets to build a model, that will be able to recognize handwritten digit in range from 0 - 9

Bellow, you can see short description of the files in this repository 

.h5 - our saved model

in cnn_handwritting_load_model - source code for the model. You can tweak some hyperparameters, to experement with the model

cnn_handwritting = here you can load the model and test it

gui - interface for the digit recognition
